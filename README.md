# Country GIF API Generator 

### Link: https://thegreekcuban.github.io/API-Homework/

### This application is a GIF Generator of your favorite countries around the world. We use JavaScript to dynamically create buttons. When you enter a search term and click add, the term used is triggers a button creation function that dynamically creates a new button with the search term used. In addition, by clicking add there is a simultaneous API call that retrieves Gifs related to the country entered and then prepends them to the page. This same function is run using the buttons as well so the user can have a history of what was searched and re-populate the page with those gifs.
